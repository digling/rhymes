# Annotation of [Behr 2008](:bib:Behr2008)

## Where to find the Corpus

* Corpus starts at p. 145 and ends at 380
* details on the inscriptions and sources can be found at pp 131

## How to annotate the corpus

### Goal

Render the corpus in a spreadsheet (Excel or LibreOffice), so that it can be easily converted into a database.

### Structure of the Corpus

1. The corpus is divided into Western and Eastern Zhōu, this should be annotated (e.g., by making two files).

2. Each corpus has some bibliiographic annotation. We want to store all of this to be exact.

3. Each corpus start with a table, listing the rhyme words along with additional information, like Number, Character, Pīnyīn, MC (Middle Chinese), HOCP (Old Chinese, revised), FQ (Fǎnqiè) GY (Guǎngyùn: initial and rhyme), T (tone), G (Division), L (?), R (rhyme in Old Chinese), ρ (Rhyme schema in poem). All this information should be included into the spreadsheet.

4. Behr also lists the metrum of each line. We do not need to have this in the spreadsheet, but it is needed to determine the rhyme structure.

5. it follows the translation, glossed, which is NOT line by line, so one needs to look at the metrum and type the data into lines, accordingly. 

### How to annotate

We want to have as much info as possible. So each annotation will be done by adding data into a spreadsheet, in multiple tables. Below I give a detailed example. Here are comments regarding the columns (generally: split in two spreadsheets, one for Western, one for Eastern):

1. Number, this is the number of the corpus item
2. Poem: the name (omit the detailed references)
3. Page: give page-rank (NUMBER if it covers one page, NUMBER+f if it covers two pages, NUMBER--NUMBER if it covers more than two pages)
4. ID: first column in the data
5. Position: superscript later after first column in the table
6. Character, Pinyin, MC, OC, up to Division: unproblematic values from the table,we want to have all.
7. Don't know hwat this column means, but we should also have it.
8. Final, Rhyme: seems to be clear, we take the values LITERALLY from the source.
9. Chinese text: Looking at the metrum is important to determine the structure here, but normally, each metrical line ends with a rhyme or a dummy "X", so retain all this information, and we just add characters as in the text, that is, behind the rhyme word.
10. German translation: note, that German translation does not necessarily END with the rhyme word. So rhyme word will be put in squared brackets, and one needs to search for the logical context. We can discuss to omit German text if it turns out to be too difficult, in this case, we want the translated word, however, as this may serve as a gloss for the meaning of the rhyming word.
