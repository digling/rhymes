# Evidence in Traditional Chinese Phonology

In this repository, we try to collect various kinds of evidence which are used in Traditional Chinese Phonology (*yīnyùnxué* 音韵学). In general, we plan to collect ALL kinds of evidence which is used in topics like Old Chinese reconstruction, as long as it is not singular, that is, as long as it is of a considerable size that it makes sense to regularize it and provide it as dataset. In this way, we hope to contribute to the important task of making reconstruction of the different stages of Chinese more transparent and reliable.

# Types of Evidence

* rhyme patterns (explicit annotations of scholars regarding the question of what rhymes in what collection of texts, as found in Wang1980, Baxter1992)
* transliterations (in Chinese and from Chinese to other languages, we consider using alignments to represent these explicitly)
* dialect data (mainly character readings, potentially also words, etc.)
* *fǎnqiè* collections, as given in different sources from the late Hàn times onwards
* collections of lento character readings as evidenced across difference sources (e.g., writing 不律 (?) to mean 笔, etc.)
* xiéshēng series as evidenced by different authors (Zhèngzhāng vs. Schuessler vs. Karlgren)
